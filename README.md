Ozone's main purpose is to manage your notifications from other server's announcements to save you time when you get on to check them.
The hope is when you open discord you go to your personalized channel and are able to see what new events are happening. This will be done by setting up a server and feeding other server's announcements into separate channels, we will be using a few of the UCF clubs to get it running. Then, we actually program the bot to essentially funnel the information from those channels and send us messages into our inbox kinda like email filtering into folders.

If we finished that we could go so far as to make Ozone be able to input events into a google calendar or send texts to your phone via discord to alert you that there is an event coming up. Of course this is a work in progress and I am very happy to work with everyone! More suggestions may be added in the future as I am very open to things but I believe the base of Ozone must be a notification assistant bot that can be personalized to anyone's needs quickly and effectively."
